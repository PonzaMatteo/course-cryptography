# Assignment 2

1. Write a program that calculate MD5, SHA-1 and SHA-256 cryptographic hash functions different texts. 
2. Use Salt for each of the hashing. (Study Salt before doing that).  
3. Investigate the computation time required for these algorithms (using any functions of your preferred language) and find the order of these algorithms based on computational efficiency.
